/// Universal properties are RDF properties that have no explicitly defined domain
/// and can therefore be applied to any resource within this vocabulary's context.
/// In RDF, when a property has no rdfs:domain constraint, it can theoretically be
/// used with any subject, but best practice is to use them only within
/// the intended vocabulary context.
///
/// This class collects all such properties from the Sync vocabulary to make them
/// easily accessible without cluttering the class-specific property interfaces.

  /// Identifies the semantic RDF class of the resources being managed (e.g., schema:Recipe). Used in two contexts: (1) Within solid:TypeRegistration entries where solid:forClass is sync:ManagedDocument, enabling framework-aware applications to discover containers holding specific semantic types. (2) Directly on sync:ManagedDocument instances to enable efficient garbage collection and retention policies without requiring document content fetching.
