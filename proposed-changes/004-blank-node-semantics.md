* We have to add a new rule: Blank Nodes that are not referenced, are considered non-existent and will be effectively removed. This is necessary since we cannot identify them across documents and thus cannot merge them properly.
* The inheritance of class and global merge rules should be specified. The implementation now defines, that properties of a class rule that are undefined, will be filled with the property from global predicate rule. And if a type is not specified for the resource, then we try to infer the type from the predicate, and use the type predicate rules if available. If the predicate has rules for no or multiple types, we use only the global rules.
