## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1. Framework Overview

This document outlines an architecture for building **offline-first, collaborative, and truly interoperable applications** using Solid Pods as a synchronization backend. The core challenge is twofold: first, to enable robust, conflict-free data merging without sacrificing semantic interoperability; and second, to provide a scalable solution for building performant applications, regardless of dataset size.

The proposed solution addresses both challenges through a declarative, developer-centric framework. Unlike operation-based approaches (such as SU-Set) that synchronize individual change events, our architecture uses a **state-based CRDT model**. This means the entire state of a resource is synchronized, a choice that works seamlessly with passive storage backends like Solid Pods. To ensure data integrity, developers declaratively **link data properties to CRDT merge strategies**. To manage performance, they define a high-level **Sync Strategy** per type (full, groups, or on-demand). This approach allows the library to act as a flexible "add-on" to an existing application, rather than a monolithic database, while ensuring all data at rest on the Solid Pod is clean, standard RDF.

For comprehensive performance analysis, benchmarks, and mobile considerations, see [PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md).

### 1.2. Implementation Model

The technical complexity described in this document is intended to be encapsulated within a reusable synchronization library (such as `solid-crdt-sync`). Application developers interact with a simple, declarative API while the library handles all CRDT algorithms, index management, conflict resolution, and Pod communication. The detailed specifications in this document serve as implementation guidance for library authors and reference for understanding the underlying system behavior.

### 1.3. Scale and Design Constraints

This framework is designed for personal to small-organization scale collaboration, targeting **2-100 installations** with optimal performance at **2-20 installations**. Primary use cases include personal synchronization across multiple devices (2-5 installations), family collaboration (5-15 installations), and small teams or friend groups (10-20 installations). Extended use cases support small organizations up to 100 installations. Beyond this scale, different architectural assumptions around centralized coordination, professional IT support, and enterprise-grade infrastructure might be more appropriate.

### 1.4. Current Scope and Limitations

**Single-Pod Focus:** This framework is designed for CRDT synchronization within a single Solid Pod. All collaborating installations work with data stored in one Pod, with multiple users (WebIDs) able to participate through separate installations.

**Multi-Pod Integration Limitation:** Applications requiring data integration across multiple Pods (such as displaying Alice's recipes from `https://alice.pod/` alongside Bob's recipes from `https://bob.pod/`) need additional orchestration beyond this specification. While IRIs ensure global uniqueness across Pods, the challenges include:
- Discovery and connection management across multiple Pods
- Semantic relationship resolution across Pod boundaries
- Cross-Pod query coordination and performance optimization
- Multi-source synchronization architecture and user experience

**Future Evolution:** Multi-Pod application integration represents a significant architectural enhancement planned for future specification versions (v2/v3). See FUTURE-TOPICS.md Section 10 for detailed analysis of the challenges and potential approaches.
