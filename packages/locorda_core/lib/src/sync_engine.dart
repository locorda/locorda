  /// Configure subscription to a group index with the given group key.
  ///
  /// ## Group Index Subscription Overview
  ///
  /// Group subscriptions determine how items within a group are fetched and synced:
  ///
  /// **Default State**: Groups are not subscribed by default. Items can still be
  /// accessed on-demand, but no automatic sync or prefetching occurs.
  ///
  /// **Implicit Subscriptions**: When individual items are fetched, groups they
  /// belong to (via their `idx:belongsToIndexShard` properties) are automatically subscribed
  /// with `ItemFetchPolicy.onRequest`. This ensures basic sync functionality.
  ///
  /// **Explicit Configuration**: This method allows you to explicitly configure
  /// a group's subscription with a specific fetch policy:
  /// - `ItemFetchPolicy.onRequest`: Fetch items only when specifically requested
  /// - `ItemFetchPolicy.prefetch`: Eagerly fetch all items in the group
  ///
  /// ## Subscription Lifecycle
  ///
  /// - **Create**: First call creates subscription with specified policy
  /// - **Update**: Subsequent calls update the fetch policy
  /// - **Persistence**: Subscriptions persist across app restarts
  /// - **No Unsubscribe**: Once subscribed, groups cannot be unsubscribed as
  ///   the subscription is required for proper sync management of items
  ///
  /// ## Technical Details
  ///
  /// Validates that G is a valid group type for the specified localName,
  /// converts the group key to RDF triples, and generates group identifiers
  /// using the configured GroupKeyGenerator.
  ///
  /// ## Example
  /// ```dart
  /// // Configure current month for eager fetching
  /// await syncSystem.configureGroupIndexSubscription(
  ///   NoteGroupKey.currentMonth,
  ///   ItemFetchPolicy.prefetch
  /// );
  ///
  /// // Later, change to on-demand fetching
  /// await syncSystem.configureGroupIndexSubscription(
  ///   NoteGroupKey.currentMonth,
  ///   ItemFetchPolicy.onRequest
  /// );
  /// ```
  ///
  /// Throws [GroupIndexGraphSubscriptionException] if:
  /// - No GroupIndex is configured for type G with the given localName
  /// - The group key cannot be serialized to RDF
  /// - No group identifiers can be generated from the group key
  ///

  /// Save an object with CRDT processing.
  ///
  /// Stores the object locally and triggers sync if connected to Solid Pod.
  /// Application state is updated via the hydration stream - repositories should
  /// listen to hydrateStream() to receive updates.
  ///
  /// Process:
  /// 1. CRDT processing (merge with existing, clock increment)
  /// 2. Store locally in sync system
  /// 3. Hydration stream automatically emits update

  /// Ensures a resource is available locally, fetching it from the remote source if necessary.
  ///
  /// This method guarantees that after its successful completion, the requested
  /// resource will exist in the local database and be managed by the sync system.
  /// It follows a "offline-first" approach.
  ///
  /// The process is as follows:
  /// 1. It first attempts to retrieve the item from the local database using the
  ///    provided [loadFromLocal] function.
  /// 2. If the item is found locally, it is returned immediately.
  /// 3. If the item is not found locally, this method triggers a fetch from the
  ///    remote Solid Pod.
  /// 4. Once fetched, the item is processed and inserted into the local database
  ///    via the standard hydration stream, which in turn makes it available to the
  ///    rest of the application.
  /// 5. The method then returns the newly fetched and stored item.
  ///
  /// This is the primary method repositories should use for on-demand loading of
  /// individual resources that may not be part of an eagerly synced group. It
  /// abstracts away all the complexity of network requests, caching, and state
  /// management.
  ///
  /// Throws a [TimeoutException] if the remote fetch takes too long.
  ///
  ///
  /// #### Parameters:
  ///   - [id]: The unique identifier of the resource to ensure is available.
  ///   - [loadFromLocal]: A callback function that takes the resource `id` and
  ///     is responsible for loading it from the local application database.
  ///
  /// #### Returns:
  /// A `Future` that completes with the resource of type [T] once it is available
  /// locally. Returns `null` if the resource cannot be found either locally or
  /// remotely, or if the request times out.
  ///
  /// #### Example:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// // Inside a repository class
  ///
  /// Future<Note?> getNoteById(String noteId) async {
  ///   return await _syncSystem.ensure<Note>(
  ///     noteId,
  ///     loadFromLocal: (id) async {
  ///       final driftNote = await _noteDao.getNoteById(id);
  ///       return driftNote != null ? _noteFromDrift(driftNote) : null;
  ///     },
  ///   );
  /// }
  /// ```

  /// Delete a document with CRDT processing.
  ///
  /// This performs document-level deletion, marking the entire document as deleted
  /// and affecting all resources contained within, following CRDT semantics.
  /// Application state is updated via the hydration stream - repositories should
  /// listen to hydrateStream() to receive deletion notifications.
  ///
  /// Process:
  /// 1. Add crdt:deletedAt timestamp to document
  /// 2. Perform universal emptying (remove semantic content, keep framework metadata)
  /// 3. Store updated document in sync system
  /// 4. Hydration stream automatically emits deletion (via Drift's reactive queries)

  /// Hydrates resources of the specified type using a reactive stream.
  ///
  /// Returns a stream of [HydrationBatch]es containing updates, deletions,
  /// and cursor information.
  ///
  /// ## Without Index (indexName == null)
  /// Hydrates complete resource documents:
  /// - Loads all existing documents in batches (bounded by [initialBatchSize])
  /// - Switches to reactive mode for ongoing changes (via Drift's watch())
  /// - Orders documents by updatedAt ascending for consistent processing
  /// - Emits (primaryTopicIri, appGraph) for each resource
  ///
  /// ## With Index (indexName != null)
  /// Hydrates lightweight index entries from the specified index:
  /// - Loads index entries in batches (bounded by [initialBatchSize])
  /// - Switches to reactive mode for ongoing changes
  /// - **Entry-level change tracking**: Only changed entries are re-emitted,
  ///   not entire shards. Uses progressive cursor tracking to minimize overhead.
  /// - Extracts entries with indexed properties only (not full resources)
  /// - Emits (resourceIri, entryGraph) for each indexed item
  /// - For GroupIndex: Automatically handles subscription changes and loads
  ///   historical data for newly subscribed groups
  ///
  /// ## Performance Characteristics
  /// - **Batch Loading Phase**: Controlled by [initialBatchSize], loads existing
  ///   data in configurable chunks to avoid memory spikes
  /// - **Reactive Phase**: Only emits entries that have actually changed since
  ///   the last emission, using entry-level timestamps for efficient filtering
  /// - **Memory Footprint**: Minimal overhead (one cursor int per active stream)
  ///
  /// The caller is responsible for:
  /// - Providing the current cursor position via [cursor]
  /// - Processing updates and deletions from the batch
  /// - Persisting cursor updates for resume capability
  ///
