# TODO

## Up Next

### Priority 1: Document Persistence (Core Foundation)
- [x] Storage Layer: save documents
- [x] LocordaGraphSync: save base implementation
- [x] merge-contract: Implement loading and merging the mappings documents and make them usable via dart classes
- [ ] merge-contract: Pre-Cache (e.g during build/deliver with the software), cache (e.g. after fetching) and refresh shared library and application documents like the mappings.ttl, so that the app can run fully offline, but is updated when online.
- [x] Use data from mapping documents to build the stop-word list to correctly separate appGraph from framework data in processing of the old stored document
- [x] Implement context-identification for blank nodes 
- [ ] Use context-identification as a base for `List<PropertyChange>` passed to storage layer instead of IriTerm for resource identification
- [x] rdf canonicalizationÂ 
- [x] fix w3id.org redirects
- [ ] Storage Layer: save locorda indices
- [ ] Implement locorda index files in db and fill/update them on save
- [ ] Create tombstones on save where needed (e.g. change detection)
- [ ] What about tombstones for blank nodes?
- [ ] Implement saving/loading/merging documents with local storage persistence
  - Currently `save()` just emits hydration events without storage persistence
  - Need CRDT merging logic and actual storage operations => CRDT merging is not part of pure persistence
  - This unblocks the example app's core functionality
 
### Priority 2: SyncManager with Status Stream
- [ ] Create SyncManager with status stream and automatic sync triggering
  - Essential for user-facing sync control and feedback
  - Enables manual/automatic sync triggering
  - Foundation for all higher-level sync operations

### Priority 3: Index Processing
- [ ] Complete index creation and group subscription handling
  - Complete group subscription and index creation logic
  - Currently stubbed in `configureGroupIndexSubscription()`
  - Needed for efficient data organization and sync

### Priority 4: Backend Implementations
- [ ] Implement in-memory backend for testing and development
  - Simpler to implement than Solid backend
  - Enables testing without external dependencies
  - Good foundation for understanding backend interface

- [ ] Implement Solid backend with actual Pod storage operations
  - Most complex but enables the full vision
  - Requires Pod operations, authentication integration
  - Can reuse patterns from in-memory backend

## Later
- [ ] Final check if the spec in ARCHITECTURE.md is fully implemented

## Done
- [x] Migrate to W3ID.org permanent IRIs
- [x] Clarify: can we include localhost into the client-config.json document to support local debugging? Or should we rather not do that since it would open up our app to attacks? => better not, plus: removed linux/windows support and adviced against those platforms
- [x] Refactor: Solid should only be one possible backend - rename from solid_crdt_sync to locorda and split the spec as well
- [x] Refactor: I am thinking about adding something like LocordaGraphSync which would be similar to LocordaSync, but not based on dart objects + mapper, but on pure RdfGraph instances. The Idea is, that LocordaGraphSync should be used by LocordaSync for the actual work, so that LocordaSync itself adds the dart object conversion on top of the more basic sync service. Clarify if I want to do it now or possibly later => done
- [x] Clarify: What is the most-user-friendly way to approach http? should we simply assume that we are provided with http client, or is it best practice for a library like ours to abstract this away? Remember: http would need to be integrated with solid DPoP, is this in our control, or should we offload it to the developer? => http.Client is an interface, let users optionally provide an instance - this is common practice and other networking implementations have adapters for this interface.
