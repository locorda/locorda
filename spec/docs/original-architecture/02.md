## 2. Core Principles

* **Offline-First:** The application must be fully functional offline, working primarily with data cached on the device. To ensure this principle remains practical for large datasets, the architecture supports optional partial sync strategies. This allows an application to work with a local, consistent cache of the *relevant* data, maintaining speed and offline availability without requiring a full data download.

* **CRDT Interoperability:** The data is clean, standard RDF within CRDT-managed documents (`sync:ManagedDocument`). CRDT-enabled applications achieve interoperability by discovering managed resources via `sync:managedResourceType` and following the public merge contracts that define collaboration rules.

* **Declarative Merge Behavior:** Developers define the merge behavior for each piece of data by declaratively linking its properties to well-defined **state-based** CRDT types (e.g., `LWW-Register`, `OR-Set`). This is done in a **public, discoverable rules file**, abstracting away the complexity of the underlying algorithms. The framework supports both class-scoped rules (property mappings) and global rules (predicate mappings) to provide flexibility in defining merge semantics. This state-based approach is fundamental to the architecture's design as it works seamlessly with passive storage backends.

* **Managed Resource Discoverability:** The system is designed to be self-describing for CRDT-enabled applications. Compatible applications can discover CRDT-managed resources through `sync:ManagedDocument` Type Index registrations with `sync:managedResourceType` filtering. From a managed resource, clients can discover merge rules (`sync:isGovernedBy`) and index shards (`idx:belongsToIndexShard`), enabling CRDT-enabled applications to collaborate safely while remaining invisible to incompatible applications.

* **Decentralized & Server-Agnostic:** The Solid Pod acts as a simple, passive storage bucket. All synchronization logic resides within the client-side library.
