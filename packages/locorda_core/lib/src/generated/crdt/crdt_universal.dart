/// Universal Properties for the Crdt vocabulary
///
/// Universal properties are RDF properties that have no explicitly defined domain
/// and can therefore be applied to any resource within this vocabulary's context.
/// In RDF, when a property has no rdfs:domain constraint, it can theoretically be
/// used with any subject, but best practice is to use them only within
/// the intended vocabulary context.
///
/// This class collects all such properties from the Crdt vocabulary to make them
/// easily accessible without cluttering the class-specific property interfaces.

  /// Framework-managed timestamp marking when a document or installation was created/recreated. Uses OR-Set semantics to support recreation scenarios and solve zombie deletion problems. Combined with crdt:deletedAt using temporal ordering: document is deleted if max(deletedAt) > max(createdAt). Framework automatically adds creation timestamps during document creation.

  /// Framework-managed timestamp marking when a document or property value was deleted. For documents: uses OR-Set semantics combined with crdt:createdAt for temporal lifecycle management (document deleted if max(deletedAt) > max(createdAt)), solving zombie deletion problems during recreation scenarios. For property values: simple tombstone semantics using RDF reification (value deleted if reification statement with crdt:deletedAt exists). Framework automatically manages this property by detecting deletions through state comparison - developers simply provide updated resource state and the library implementation handles tombstone creation automatically.
