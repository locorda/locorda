Used in two contexts: (1) Within solid:TypeRegistration entries where solid:forClass is sync:ManagedDocument, enabling framework-aware applications to discover containers holding specific semantic types. (2) Directly on sync:ManagedDocument instances to enable efficient garbage collection and retention policies without requiring document content fetching.";
